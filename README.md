# Predictive-Modeling-of-Health-Insurance-Charges-Key-Influencing-Factors

The insurance policy premiums are very closely associated with multiple factors
which include income, medical history, and geographical location. Higher body
mass index (BMI) individuals are often subjected to higher premiums, which
serves as a valuable indicator of obesity and its associated health risks. Regarding
this, the charged premiums for tobacco users are markedly higher as compared to
their nonsmoking counterparts, signifying the increased risk of smoking.The aim of
this study is to illuminate these intricate correlations and how they affect the
creation and cost of insurance policies. Using several regression models like Linear
Regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forest, Random Forest with Principle
Component Analysis (PCA), Decision Tree, Decision Tree with Hyperparameter
Tuning, Gradient Boosting using XGBoost, Gradient Boosting using LightGBM,
Support Vector Regression, LM with interaction, RF_interaction and K-means
clustering, we aim to forecast insurance costs and compare the performance of
these models. Through a comprehensive analysis, this study aims to provide
individuals with insight into the impact of health factors on insurance pricing,
allowing them to make informed decisions about managing their health and
insurance coverage.
